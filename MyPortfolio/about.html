  <h2> About this Portfolio </h2>
      <p> This portfolio was created as a way for me to organize and show my work to future potential employers. It includes both Digital and Traditional Art, as well as subcategories in each. Everything from animations to charcoal drawings is present on this site.</p>

      <p> Both work for school and projects I have done for myself are present here. I have tried to include as much content as possible to give potential employers a good picture as to what I can do.</p>

  <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p> I was born and raised in Montana and attended the University of Montana, where I got a Bachelor's degree in Media Arts. Even after graduation, I continue to create content with the knowledge I have gleaned from my college career.</p>
